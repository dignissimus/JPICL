# JPICL
Java/Python Interpreted Compiled Langued, An Interpreted/"Compiled" language that was supposed to be like python but turned out to look something a bit similar to ruby
# Tutorial
## Syntax
```
print "hello"
print "I can use multiple" "parameters"
print "That's more than" 1
print "I can do addition 6*7 = " 6 * 7
```
### Dynamic typing
```
a = 1
print a
a = "string"
print a
```
### Usage
```java -jar JPICL.jar code.txt [--java]```
the --java parameter outputs the Java equivalent of your code to STODUT
without this, the interpreter will run your code
